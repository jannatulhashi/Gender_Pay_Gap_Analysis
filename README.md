# "UK Gender Pay Gap Analysis"
Exploring wage gaps between genders in UK companies with 250+ employees from 2018-2023.

## About the Dataset: 

###  Overview

**Background:**

In the UK, big organizations (those with over 250 staff members) must share data yearly about the difference in average pay between their male and female employees. This isn't about men and women getting the same pay for the same job, which is already a legal rule. Rather, it's about understanding broader pay differences linked to roles, promotions, and experience. This information helps us spot and address deep-rooted biases and supports our push for gender fairness in workplaces.

**What's Inside:**

This collection holds information gathered by the Gender Pay Gap Service from 2018/19 to 2022/23 years. Companies share this data themselves through the Gender Pay Gap Service online platform. On this platform, people can also explore different companies' pay gap details or even compare them side by side.

All data has been taken from the GOV.UK Gender Pay Gap Service's downloads, available here: [(https://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/viewing/download)]

### Why did I choose this dataset?

I chose this dataset because it focuses on gender pay differences, a key aspect of inclusivity and diversity. By examining these numbers, we can better understand where gaps exist and work to close them. It's important to ensure everyone is treated fairly and equally in the workplace, and this data helps highlight areas that need attention. Making informed decisions based on this data can lead to a more inclusive and diverse environment for all.
